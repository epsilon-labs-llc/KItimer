# KItimer

KItimer is a countdown timer app designed specifically for **Kings Island** visitors in Ohio. The app helps users track the availability of their **Drink Pass** (15-minute cooldown) and **Dining Pass** (4-hour cooldown) with easy-to-use timers and notifications. Even when the app is in the background, KItimer ensures accurate countdowns and timely reminders.

## Features

### üïí Timer Management
- **Drink Pass Timer**: Counts down from 15 minutes, displayed in `mm:ss` format.
- **Dining Pass Timer**: Counts down from 4 hours, displayed in `hh:mm:ss` format.
- Accurate countdowns, even when the app is in the background.

### üîî Notifications
- Alerts users when their pass is available again:
  - Drink Pass: *"Your Drink Pass is Available!"*
  - Dining Pass: *"Your Dining Pass is Available!"*
- Notifications work seamlessly even if the app is not active.
- Resetting the timer cancels all scheduled notifications.

### üé® User Interface
- Minimalist design with intuitive controls:
  - **Start Button**: Green when active; disables after starting.
  - **Reset Button**: Red and only visible after the timer starts.
  - Dynamic alignment ensures the interface doesn‚Äôt interfere with iPhone features like the Dynamic Island.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Background Time Handling
- Tracks elapsed time while the app is in the background to ensure accurate countdowns upon return.
- Prevents unintended restarts for other timers when switching between foreground and background states.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Timer**:
   - Tap the **Start** button to begin a countdown for either the Drink Pass or Dining Pass.
   - The timer starts counting down, and a notification is scheduled for when the timer ends.

2. **Background Operation**:
   - If you close or minimize the app, the timer continues to track the time elapsed.
   - Upon reopening, the timer adjusts for the time spent in the background.

3. **Reset the Timer**:
   - Tap the **Reset** button to stop the timer and return it to its initial state.
   - All notifications tied to the timer are canceled.
